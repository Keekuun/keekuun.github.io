# 安装依赖
flutter pub get <package>

flutter pub remove <package>
# 更新依赖
flutter pub upgrade <package>

Flutter使用`pub`工具来管理包，可以通过`pubspec.yaml`文件来指定项目所需的依赖包，并通过运行`flutter pub get`命令来下载和安装这些依赖包。

在项目根目录下打开`terminal`，执行以下命令：：
```bash
flutter pub add pinyin
```
flutter 包管理工具会自动下载[`pinyin`](https://pub-web.flutter-io.cn/packages/pinyin)包最新版本，并且更新`pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  pinyin: ^3.2.0  #latest version
```
使用`pinyin`包：
```dart
// Import package
import 'package:pinyin/pinyin.dart';

void main() {
  String text = "你好，拼音！";
  String pinyin = PinyinHelper.getPinyin(text);
  
  print('pinyin: $pinyin'); // pinyin: nihao， pinyin!
}
```

## 包管理配置文件`pubspec.yaml`

`pubspec.yaml`详解：
```yaml
# 应用名称
name: hello_flutter
# 应用描述
description: "A new Flutter project."
# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
# 发布配置
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.
# 应用包版本，说明：版本号 x.y.z+m 其中 m 是构建版本，可以使用 --build-name/--build-number 构建参数覆盖，在 android 中 build-name 当作 versionName使用，build-number 当作versionCode使用
version: 1.0.0+1

# 应用或包的开发环境 flutter的SDK版本在此区间 这个会影响到下面引用的插件依赖库
environment:
  sdk: '>=3.3.1 <4.0.0'

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.
# 应用或包依赖的其他包或插件

  # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
  # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
  # 默认加载的IOS图标
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.6

# 开发环境依赖的工具包（而不是Flutter应用本身依赖的包）
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.
  flutter_lints: ^3.0.0

# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the
# following page: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  # 默认生成--使用android material-design 图标
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # 字体库添加
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
```
